# What is this?

A repo for the survivor buddy lab assignment


# What needs to be done?

The end goal is have the survivor buddy react to a handful of gesture inputs from you.

### Main Steps

1. Get ROS + Rviz running
- its linux-only so you'll need to dual boot or install a VM
    - unless you have a M1 mac (like me) where there's basically only two options
        - pay for [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/)
        - find/get a not-M1 Linux PC 
        - Note: On M1 I have tried docker, I have tried virtualbox, I have tried building from source. All of combined wasted about 2 weeks of my life.
- if you have a hard time setting it up, let me know as I have a bootable flashdrive you can clone. It has everything setup on it
2. Get the lab working in Rviz
3. Meet with me in person so we can push the code to survivor buddy and see if it works on a real robot
